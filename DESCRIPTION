Description: Functions related to the new dimension reduction method, DISCA. 
  The projected subspaces can be of equal dimensions or non-equal dimensions, 
  and the two random vectors are simultaneously dimension reduced.
  *DISCA.R* and *DISCA_fwd.R* performs dimension reduction for two related random vectors simultaneously, with back-elimination and forward-selection procedures, respectively;
  *minDCOV.R* and *maxDCOV.R* calculates the projection vector of a random variable, which minimizes (maximizes) empirical distance covariance;
  *dcovU.test.R* performs permutation bootstrap method for independence test, based on unbiased distance covariance estimator;
  *gMatrix.R* calculates the g-matrix mentioned in Lemma 4.1 in DISCA paper;
  *Mminus.R* and *Mplus.R* calculates the M-minus and M-plus matrix mentioned in Lemma 4.1 in DISCA paper.
